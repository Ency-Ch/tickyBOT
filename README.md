# tickyBOT
clone of a tickyBOT landing page
for my solo project i have chosen the tickyBOt landing that forms part of your specs.
the majority of it is in HTML and CSS with just a bit of Javascript. I am fairly comfortable with javascript though i have not used much of it on this project
Some of the transitions in css have not worked well, but i thought i would push the minimal viable project  and get feedback before i try to perfect everything.
